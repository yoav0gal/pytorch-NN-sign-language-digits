## Notebook outline:

**0. MUST HAVE DOWNLOADS (run me for the rest for the noteboobk to work)**

**1. Neural Network with PyTorch part 1 (Binary Classification):**

- 1.1 Imports.
- 1.2 Data preprocessing.
- 1.3 Build the network.
- 1.4 Training.
- 1.5 Testing and Evaluating.

**2. Neural Network with PyTorch part 2 (Multiclass Classification):**

- 2.1 Part 1 - build train and evaluate the different models:
    - 2.1.1 Imports.
    - 2.1.2 Data preprocessing.
    - 2.1.3 The different models and their architecture.
    - 2.1.4 Train test and compare the models.
        **note**: we are skipping the training of the models to train yourself, delete the `%%script echo skipping` in the models training cell.
    
- 2.2 Test Environment:
    - 2.2.1 Imports, downloads and code context.
    - 2.2.2 Single prediction.


## How to use: 
**FIRST OF ALL:**
>Run section 0 to install the basic stuff this notebook needs.

### Run part 1:
    Just run all if part one cells


### Test part 2:
    Run all cells in section 2.2 to test test our best modal and upload a file from the examples folder (would also be available in the notebook content folder).

### Train part 2:
    Run all The cells in section 2.1 to train the different models and compare them.
